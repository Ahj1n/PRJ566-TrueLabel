# Summary
Consumers today struggle to quickly identify whether a product’s parent company engages in ethical or sustainable practices. Our solution is a mobile app that allows users to scan a product’s QR or barcode and instantly access the company’s history, ethical track record, and country of origin. To make this information more actionable, the app will also generate a simple ethical rating score that users can quickly view at a glance. By empowering consumers with this knowledge at the point of purchase, the app encourages ethical consumption and supports the growing movement toward transparency and locally made products. 

Our app helps consumers make smarter, more ethical shopping decisions by revealing the story behind every product.
